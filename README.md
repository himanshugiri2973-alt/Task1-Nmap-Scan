# Basic Network Scanning with Nmap

This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the Oasis Infobyte Cybersecurity Internship.  
The task was to perform a basic network scan using Nmap to identify open ports and services on my local machine.

## About the Task
Nmap is a commonly used network scanning tool.  
I used it to scan localhost and analyze open ports and running services.

## Scans Performed
- Basic scan: `nmap localhost`
- Service/version scan: `nmap -sV localhost`
- Aggressive scan: `nmap -A localhost`

## Files Included
- **nmap_scan_results.txt** – Output of the aggressive scan  
- **screenshots/** – Screenshots of each scan  
- **README.md** – Documentation for this task

## Tools Used
- Nmap (Windows version)
